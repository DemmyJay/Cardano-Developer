module ExceptionHandling where
import Control.Exception
 
{- 
   * This module demonstrates effective mechanisms for Throwing, Catching, Handling and recovering from Exceptions in a safe and expressive way.
   * Throwing Exceptions means halting the the current programs execution and sending a signal with some information about what went wrong. That signal is the exception.
   * Catching and Handling exceptions makes the program more resilient.
