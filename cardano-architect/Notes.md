# Cardano Solutions Arch

## Cardano Smart Contract Development Stack

### On-chain Validator Development Languages

- Plutus - Very high level, easy readability and writability, any inlinable Haskell function.

- Helios - JavaScript-based, 50% more efficient than Plutus, not type-safe, not very abstract.

- Plutarch - Very low level, 4-6x more efficient than Plutus, type-safe, not very abstract.

- Plu-ts - Typescript based language, 25% more efficient than Plutus.

- Aiken - Rust based incomplete.

### Off-chain Transaction Building Languages

- Lucid - JavaScript / TypeScript based, designed for simplicity, readability, writability, but not a lot of documentation.

- Martify Mesh - JavaScript / TypeScript based, most extensive documentation, designed for ease of use, readability, and writability, a little less robust than Lucid.

- Kuber - Haskell-based transaction builder, a robust Haskell solution.

- MLabs PAB - useable, but very complicated, basically Haskell wrapped Cardano-CLI.

- Atlas: Genius Yield's Open-source PAB - The most robust Haskell solution.Â  

- CTL - My personal favorite, PureScript based, painful to setup, very good readability / writability, and very robust.

  - [Folding/Traversing over a list](https://mlabs.slab.com/public/posts/on-chain-association-list-with-constant-time-insert-removal-sh8z2xzy)
  The folding validator works by accumulating the values of all the UTxOs using some accumulator function.

Note
: The folding is done on-chain, each transaction takes the fold utxo (containing the datum with the accumulator/integer datum in this case)  locked at the fold validator and spends that utxo, reading over linked list nodes and adding their value to the datum of the fold UTxO.
: The idea of the transaction token pattern is that validation logic occurs at the transaction level instead of the UTxO level. Normally, when you use a normal spending validator, if you unlock 3 utxos at the smart contract address, the script will run 3 times, once for each input.
: A minting policy operates at the transaction level, in the sense that all the utxos can be validated by executing the minting policy once, instead of 3 times. Then for each utxo being unlocked, instead of running a ton of validation logic, all it does is check that a minting policy is executed successfully.

  **Use case of The Transaction Token pattern:**
    Auction
    Staking
  **Terms To Search**
    Forward minting policy: This is when a minting policy forwards its logic to a validator.

 Middleware solutions for Cardano:
  - PAB (out of development): A centralized off-chain transaction builder that runs DBsync as an interface to the Blockchain
  - Frontend transaction building provider for Lucid: Blockfrost, Emulator provider, Kupmios.
  - Carp: Syncs data from the Cardano blockchain and stores it into a Postgres database as an alternative to the very heavy Blockfrost
    Other alternatives to CARP are; Oura, Kupo, Ogmios.
  - Scrolls:
  - Cardano Graph QL: This a backend infrastructure that offers direct integration with TypeScript and a Docker container that can be run easily

  - Here is a breakdown regarding what projects are using (to the best of my knowledge) for on-chain and off-chain.

    SundaeSwap:
    Onchain: Plutus V1
    Off-chain: Go / Typescript-based PAB https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/toolkit-for-cardano

    WingRiders:
    Onchain Mainnet: Plutus V1 for DEX contracts, and Plutarch V1 for auxiliary contracts (vesting, farming, etc).
    Onchain (unreleased): Plutarch V2 for both DEX & auxiliary contracts.

- Learning Plutarch:

  Setting up the Plutarch and Lucid environment.
  Building a Dapp that with a contract, requires people to mint an NFT, so if they pay they can mint an NFT.
  What is Liquid libs? It is an extension to Plutarch that introduces a lot of Plutarch instances.

Continuation of CIP68

CIP 57: Plutus Contract Blueprint.
 CIP very briefly. CIP-57 is a "Plutus Contract Blueprint". Meaning, you can take any Plutus script (that supports it) and get a blueprint of the contract. Meaning, it will tell you all the endpoints and constructors (options) you can interact with that script. So all the context of the script.

Reviewing projects:
Spacebudz: 
Wormhole: Wormhole is a project that allows you to port existing NFTs that were minted using the old metadata standard ie CIP 25 to using on-chain metadata.
Nebula: Nebula is a prebuilt open-source marketplace that you can launch in your project.

### Terms to research

Profiling tools.
What is folding a UTxO in a linked list?

### Questions

In the on-chain linked list, what do you mean by fold?
Reward UTxO
In the case of using a Transaction Token Pattern, why use a minting policies when we need to modify the datum of the UTxO that precedes the token we are trying to spend in the list? Minting policies can see the datums of the UTxOs.
